incorporate feedjira into app, allow for searching of feeds (by category?), 
allow some defaults, maybe top stories of a few different rss feeds? 

create a magazine model/migration that belongs to users
  title
  url of article

create a model/migration so that users can save feed items into their own magazine
feed = Feedjira::Feed.fetch_and_parse('http://rss.cnn.com/rss/cnn_topstories.rss')

refactoring jobs: 
———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
strip out any "http://" from the urls passed into the model, as the unique validation is failing on "http://sub.domain.com" vs "sub.domain.com"
move logic from social media controllers into models
responsive media queries/styles for the grid
more feed links on the left
pull images from feeds and populate grid items on home page
render things better (eg all songs considered npr feed: are there audio tracks?, how about videos in my twitter feed?)
